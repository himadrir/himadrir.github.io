# About me #
I am Robotics Graduate student from University at Buffalo. My key interests lie in Perception, Path Planning and Machine Learning in Autonomous Systems. I also enjoy learning and reading about new tech, application of AI/ML in sports such as football(soccer) and Formula 1. As a hobby I like playing Counter Strike, watching F1(big RedBull fan) and making interesting side projects.
